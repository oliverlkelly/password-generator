# Password Generator

## The Task

To create the functionality behind a given page format to create a password with Javascript. This password will obey a set of parameters given by user input to the page to create each password.

This project allowed me to learn more about the following;
- Javascript implimentation and use
- The ability to take a set of criteria and create a website that follows those criteria
- A deeper understanding of Javascript and it things you can do with it

## Installation

This project is a webpage, and is deployed on github pages through the following link:
    https://oliverlkelly.github.io/password-generator/

The site can also be deployed locally by pulling the file structure to your local machine and opening the index.html file in your browser of preference.

## Usage
This project can be used as a website. There are other components of the site that can be used for reference, such as the methods and logic used to create the password and randomise the resulting characters in the resulting string.

## Credits
This project was done in conjunction with the University of Sydney and Trilogy Education through their collaborated full stack bootcamp program.
